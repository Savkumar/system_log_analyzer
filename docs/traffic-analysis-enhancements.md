# Enhanced Traffic Analysis Requirements

## Traffic Analysis Summary Section

The traffic analysis summary should be enhanced to include comprehensive comparison between overall traffic and ARL-specific traffic. Here's the detailed breakdown of what should be included:

### 1. Traffic Volume Analysis
- Overall traffic volume metrics
  - Peak RPM/RPS
  - Average RPM/RPS
  - Traffic distribution over time
- ARL-specific traffic metrics
  - Peak RPM/RPS for selected ARL
  - Average RPM/RPS for selected ARL
  - Percentage of overall traffic handled by selected ARL

### 2. Traffic Pattern Comparison
- Traffic composition analysis
  - HTTPS vs HTTP ratio for overall traffic
  - HTTPS vs HTTP ratio for selected ARL
  - Protocol distribution comparison
- Peak timing correlation
  - Identify if ARL peaks align with overall traffic peaks
  - Time offset between overall and ARL peak periods
  - Pattern similarity analysis

### 3. Performance Impact Analysis
- System capacity utilization
  - Overall system load
  - ARL-specific load contribution
  - Available capacity assessment
- Resource utilization patterns
  - Impact of ARL traffic on system resources
  - Resource usage efficiency
  - Potential bottlenecks

### 4. Traffic Distribution Insights
- Geographic distribution (if available)
- Time-based patterns
  - Peak hours identification
  - Low traffic periods
  - Trend analysis
- Anomaly detection
  - Unusual traffic spikes
  - Deviation from normal patterns
  - Correlation between overall and ARL anomalies

### 5. Statistical Correlations
- Calculate and display:
  - Correlation coefficient between overall and ARL traffic
  - Traffic distribution similarity
  - Pattern matching score
  - Trend alignment percentage

## Implementation Notes

1. Data Processing
   - Implement efficient algorithms for real-time statistical analysis
   - Use moving averages for trend detection
   - Calculate correlations using appropriate statistical methods

2. Visualization
   - Clear presentation of comparative metrics
   - Highlight significant differences
   - Use color coding for easy pattern recognition
   - Interactive elements for detailed exploration

3. Performance Considerations
   - Optimize calculations for large datasets
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed metrics
   - Use efficient data structures for pattern matching
