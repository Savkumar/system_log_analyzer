# Multi-File Traffic Analysis Enhancement Plan

## Overview
Enhance the Ghost Traffic Analysis feature to support uploading and analyzing multiple RPM/RPS file pairs simultaneously, providing comparative analysis across different traffic patterns.

## Current Implementation
- Single pair file upload (RPM + RPS)
- Basic traffic visualization
- Limited to one dataset at a time

## Proposed Changes

### 1. File Upload Enhancement
- New MultiFileUploader component supporting multiple file pairs
- Automatic file categorization based on prefixes:
  * ARL_RPM.txt & ARL_RPS.txt
  * Overall_RPM.txt & Overall_RPS.txt
  * Without_ARL_RPM.txt & Without_ARL_RPS.txt
- Validation for matching file pairs

### 2. Data Structure Updates
```typescript
interface TrafficData {
  arl: {
    rpm: RPMData[];
    rps: RPSData[];
  };
  overall: {
    rpm: RPMData[];
    rps: RPSData[];
  };
  withoutArl: {
    rpm: RPMData[];
    rps: RPSData[];
  };
}
```

### 3. Visualization Enhancements
- Comparative charts showing all datasets
- Dataset toggle controls
- Enhanced metrics summary with comparisons
- Color-coded visualization for different datasets

### 4. User Experience
- Visual feedback for file categorization
- Progress indicators
- Dataset selection controls

## Implementation Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[File Upload Component] --> B[File Selection]
    B --> C[File Categorization]
    C --> D[Data Processing]
    D --> E[Visualization]

    subgraph "File Selection"
        B1[Multiple File Upload]
        B2[Drag & Drop Support]
        B3[File Type Validation]
    end

    subgraph "File Categorization"
        C1[ARL Traffic Files]
        C2[Overall Traffic Files]
        C3[Without ARL Files]
    end

    subgraph "Data Processing"
        D1[Parse RPM Data]
        D2[Parse RPS Data]
        D3[Calculate Metrics]
    end

    subgraph "Visualization"
        E1[Comparative RPM Chart]
        E2[Comparative RPS Chart]
        E3[Metrics Summary]
    end
```

## Benefits
1. Comprehensive traffic analysis
2. Easy comparison between different traffic patterns
3. Better understanding of ARL impact
4. Improved user experience with multiple file handling

## Technical Considerations
1. Performance optimization for multiple file processing
2. Memory management for larger datasets
3. Efficient data structure for comparative analysis
4. Responsive UI for multiple dataset visualization
